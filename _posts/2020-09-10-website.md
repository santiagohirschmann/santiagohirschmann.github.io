## Building this website

For this website, I used a Jekyll template called Massively, and hosted it off of a GitHub repo. The Atom text editor, which has both git and GitHub built in, served as a really easy way to edit the code and had version control functionality built in. In building this website, I learned how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown can all work together. I was also exposed to using classes and windows PowerShell for the first time.
It took quite a bit of trial and error and plenty of google searching to deliver this final product but I am pretty proud of how it has come out.
