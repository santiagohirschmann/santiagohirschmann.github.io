## Robotics Advanced Development Team, Mechanical Engineering Co-op

I had the pleasure of working on the Robotics Advanced Development team working on the Fall 2020 line of autonomous robot vacuums. Due to a unique management structure, I had the opportunity and the responsibility to determine the projects and the tasks that would be most useful to the team and it's long term goals.
<!--
This exciting position allowed me to work on countless smaller research and long term improvement projects in the beginning of my co-op. As the mass production start date began to loom I was assigned with one large consumer facing problem that I was able to design a solution for, validate, and plan for it to be implemented into mass production. Having this mix of breadth and depth in what I experienced really allowed me to grow as an engineer in this role.   -->


### Dust Bin Redesign

<i>"It was difficult to get my fingers
into the space where the dust was
clinging. I found it best to use
 something to insert and try
 to get the dust out‚Äù</i>
 -Consumer

For this project, I found that many users were complaining that they had difficulty emptying the dust out of their robot vacuums. I requested that I dive into the problem and solve it before we came out with the next model. This led me down a three month task of determining the causation of the problem, designing an effective solution, creating a test to validate that I had satisfactorily solved the problem, validating all other aspects of my design, coordinating with the manufacturing team in China, and getting the design and the tooling investment approved for mass production.
