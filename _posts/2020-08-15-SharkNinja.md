## Job Position

I had the pleasure of working on the Robotics Advanced Development team working on the Fall 2020 line of autonomous robot vacuums. At the beginning of the experience, my manager left the company leaving me under the guidance of the VP of Robotics Engineering. Because I was not managed from day to day, I had the opportunity and the responsibility to determine the projects and the tasks that would be most useful to the team and it's long term goals.

This exciting position allowed me to work on countless smaller research and long term improvement projects in the beginning of my co-op. As the mass production start date began to loom I was assigned with one large consumer facing problem that I was able to design a solution for, validate, and plan for it to be implemented into mass production. Having this mix of breadth and depth in what I experienced really allowed me to grow as an engineer in this role.  


### Design Project

clinging. I found it best to use
 something to insert and try
 to get the dust out‚Äù</i>

For this project, I found that many users were complaining that they had difficulty emptying the dust out of their robot vacuums. I requested that I dive into the problem and solve it before we came out with the next model. This led me down a three month task of determining the causation of the problem, designing an effective solution, creating a test to validate that I had satisfactorily solved the problem, validating all other aspects of my design, coordinating with the manufacturing team in China, and getting the design and the tooling investment approved for mass production.

### Air Path Optimization Project

For this project, I had the luxury of redesigning the entire dust cup from scratch and designing a future design that would read the benefits of a better airpath, improved cleaning performance, and larger dust cup volume. Initial prototypes were made but due to Covid and more urgent projects taking priority this design was never fully validated. In this project I gained a ton of experience in Solid works as I had to create this model from scratch.
