I had the pleasure of working on the Robotics Advanced Development team at Shark Ninja working on the Fall 2020 line of autonomous robot vacuums. Due to a unique management structure, I had the opportunity and the responsibility to determine the projects and the tasks that would be most useful to the team and it's long term goals.
<!--
This exciting position allowed me to work on countless smaller research and long term improvement projects in the beginning of my co-op. As the mass production start date began to loom I was assigned with one large consumer facing problem that I was able to design a solution for, validate, and plan for it to be implemented into mass production. Having this mix of breadth and depth in what I experienced really allowed me to grow as an engineer in this role.   -->

Here, I tried to design a mirrored surface in the IR receiver housing that would split a small beam of light and direct it to two sensors. This would have improved the accuracy of the docking guidance system and result in improved docking performance.
