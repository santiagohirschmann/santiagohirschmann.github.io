## Robotics Advanced Development Team, Mechanical Engineering Co-op

I had the pleasure of working on the Robotics Advanced Development team working on the Fall 2020 line of autonomous robot vacuums. Due to a unique management structure, I had the opportunity and the responsibility to determine the projects and the tasks that would be most useful to the team and it's long term goals.
<!--
This exciting position allowed me to work on countless smaller research and long term improvement projects in the beginning of my co-op. As the mass production start date began to loom I was assigned with one large consumer facing problem that I was able to design a solution for, validate, and plan for it to be implemented into mass production. Having this mix of breadth and depth in what I experienced really allowed me to grow as an engineer in this role.   -->


### Infrared Receiver Project

Here, I tried to design a mirrored surface in the IR receiver housing that would split a small beam of light and direct it to two sensors. This would have improved the accuracy of the docking guidance system and result in improved docking performance. This design ended up being too costly to be brought to MP.
