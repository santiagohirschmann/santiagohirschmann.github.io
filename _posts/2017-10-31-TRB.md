## Research
 In this research position, I worked with a PHD student to study the Uber and Lyft habits of Northeastern students, Faculty, and Staff. I found a grant for this project, obtained the necessary funding, created a survey, marketed it and amassed 2,000 responses.  We then took this data and analyzed it to produce a paper describing our findings.

This is the poster that I presented to Northeastern at an undergraduate research fair.

And this is the paper we submitted to the TRB for the presentation in DC which we presented in Jan 2020.
