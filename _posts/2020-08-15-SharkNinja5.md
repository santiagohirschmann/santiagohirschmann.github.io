I had the pleasure of working on the Robotics Advanced Development team at Shark Ninja working on the Fall 2020 line of autonomous robot vacuums. Due to a unique management structure, I had the opportunity and the responsibility to determine the projects and the tasks that would be most useful to the team and it's long term goals.
<!--
This exciting position allowed me to work on countless smaller research and long term improvement projects in the beginning of my co-op. As the mass production start date began to loom I was assigned with one large consumer facing problem that I was able to design a solution for, validate, and plan for it to be implemented into mass production. Having this mix of breadth and depth in what I experienced really allowed me to grow as an engineer in this role.   -->

<br> This project was the result of a deep dive into a DFM and DFA study (using Boothroyd Dewhurst software) where I found 35 seconds of assembly time was spent on superfluous screws in the design. These snap fits were designed to replace multiple screws in the chassis assembly and would save $75,000 annually.
