## Problem

In our research, we found that 90% of child drownings occurred in supervised environments. This is due to the fact that many kids grow tired and drown silently, without displaying the thrashing and splashing commonly looked for. This led us to try to design a device that aids in the identification of a young swimmer in trouble and aids in their rescue.



## Design

We designed a wearable device that inputs pulse oximetry data from a fingertip sensor and if a users blood oxygen levels fall below a critical criteria, the device actuates a servo that releases a bright dye into the water. This dye makes it very clear that a child is in trouble and pinpoints exactly where they are in the water.
