## Research
 In this research position, I worked with a PHD student to study the Uber and Lyft habits of Northeastern students, Faculty, and Staff. I found a grant for this project, obtained the necessary funding, created a survey, marketed it and amassed 2,000 responses.  We then took this data and analyzed it to produce a paper describing our findings.


<br>
## Key Findings
 <br>
-We proved that younger people, those with more income, and less access to cars or bikes tend to use Uber/Lyft more.
<br>
-We found that older people, those with less income, and those with less access to cars or bikes use Uber/Lyft less.
<br>
-I used a GIS system to visualize where people in the Northeastern Community go when traveling by uber and Lyft.
<br>
-We studied the reasons people choose Uber and Lyft and were suprised by how many use it for regularly for everyday activities.

This is the poster that I presented to Northeastern at an undergraduate research fair.
