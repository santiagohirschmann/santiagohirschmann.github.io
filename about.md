## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/circle-cropped.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
<br>
Professionally, I am incredibly interested in mechanical engineering and the way it allows us to design the world around us. Personally, a lot of my appreciation for design and engineering carries over. I love to ski and sail, both of which require me to understand the physics affecting, and the design of, the tools I use.

Some of my other interests include cooking, hiking, and home repair.
