## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Professionally, I am incredibly interested in mechanical engineering and the way it allows us to design the world around us. Personally, a lot of my appreciation for design and engineering carries over. I love to ski and sail, both of which require me to understand the physics affecting, and the design of, the tools I use.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
