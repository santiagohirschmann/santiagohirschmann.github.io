              <p>This is a list of some of the engineering projects I have worked on. Check out the articles below for more details.

            </header>
						<p>
					  <b> Shark Ninja, Robotics Advanced Development Team </b>
					<br>  • Designed, validated, and brought to mass production a solution to a problem in the hair wing
					 <br>   • Designed a mechanically pivoting hair wing
					  <br> • Researched compliant mechanisms, specifically using injection molded plastic
						 <br> • Designed and optimized a mirrored IR reciever
						  <br> • Performed DFM and DFA analysis
							 <br> • Used DFM and DFA results to inform the design of a snap-fit cost-down solution
							 <br> • Designed and studied optimizations within the Airpath of a Robotic Vacuum

					  </p>

						<p>
					  <b> Machine Learning Course  </b>
					<br>  • Created a Machine Learning Algorithm that tried to predict the stock market
					 <br>   • Imported images and segmented them into clusters that fit a gaussian mixture model using validation-log-likelyhood as the objecive
					  <br> • Used two layers of perceptrons and trained a model with P perceptrons to classify a 5 cluster dataset containing 10,000 samples using 10 fold cross validation

					  </p>

						<p>
						<b> Drone Research </b>
					<br>  • Helped develop a Simulink model of a small quadrocopter
					 <br>   • Worked on developing an algorithm for the optimum method of avoiding an incoming object
						<br> • Currently working on an object recognition program that will identify an incoming object

						</p>
						<p>
					  <b> Transportation Research </b>
					<br>  • Found funding for, created, and distributed a survey that amassed 2,000 responses
					 <br>   • Used this dataset to find patterns and correlations revolving Uber/ Lyft use habits
					  <br> • Co-authored a paper that was submitted and approved for presentation at the 2020 TRB conference in DC
</p>
						<p>
					  <b> Cornerstone of Engineering Course </b>
					<br>  • Designed and built a battle bot using arduino components
					 <br>   • Designed and build a prototype wristband that could detect drowning events and alert bystanders
					  <br> •The intent of the design is to prevent "supervised drownings" that sadly kill hundreds of toddlers annually
					  </p>

						<p>
						<b> Material Science Course </b>
					<br>  •Prepared metal samples for microscopic observation and then to identified them based off of their microstructure composition
					<br>   • Used X-ray diffraction to identify the composition of various unknown metals
